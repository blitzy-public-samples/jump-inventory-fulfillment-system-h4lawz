    L --> U[Update Quantity]
    T --> V[Increment Inventory]
    U --> V
    V --> W[Sync with Shopify]
    W --> R
    S --> R
```

This flowchart outlines the primary processes within the application:

1. User Authentication: The process begins with user authentication. Upon successful login, users are directed to the dashboard. Failed attempts return to the login screen.

2. Dashboard Actions: From the dashboard, users can choose to view unfulfilled orders, manage inventory, or process an order.

3. Unfulfilled Orders:
   - The system categorizes orders as fulfillable or unfulfillable based on inventory availability.
   - Fulfillable orders are moved to the processing queue.
   - Unfulfillable orders can be exported for further action.

4. Inventory Management:
   - Users can add new inventory by scanning barcodes or manual entry.
   - Existing inventory can be updated.
   - All inventory changes are synchronized with Shopify.

5. Order Processing:
   - Users scan items for the order.
   - Once all items are scanned, a shipping label is generated via the Sendle API.
   - The order status is updated in Shopify.
   - Inventory levels are decremented accordingly.

This flowchart provides a high-level overview of the application's core processes, illustrating the logical flow from order receipt to fulfillment, including inventory management tasks. The implementation will use TypeScript and React with Tailwind CSS for the frontend user interface, ensuring a responsive and intuitive design. The backend processes, including API integrations with Shopify and Sendle, will be implemented in Python, maintaining consistency with the technology choices outlined in previous sections of the SRS.

```mermaid
erDiagram
    User ||--o{ Order : manages
    User {
        string id
        string username
        string email
        string password_hash
        string role
    }
    Order ||--|{ OrderItem : contains
    Order {
        string id
        string shopify_order_id
        string status
        datetime created_at
        datetime updated_at
    }
    OrderItem {
        string id
        string order_id
        string product_id
        int quantity
    }
    Product ||--o{ OrderItem : "is in"
    Product ||--o{ InventoryItem : "has"
    Product {
        string id
        string shopify_product_id
        string name
        string sku
        string barcode
    }
    InventoryItem {
        string id
        string product_id
        int quantity
        string location
    }
```

This entity-relationship diagram illustrates the core data models for the application. The main entities are:

1. User: Represents system users (administrators and warehouse staff)
2. Order: Represents orders pulled from Shopify
3. OrderItem: Represents individual items within an order
4. Product: Represents products in the inventory
5. InventoryItem: Represents the quantity and location of products in inventory

## 6.2 DATA STORAGE

The application will use Google Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL as the primary database solution, ensuring scalability, reliability, and compatibility with the Google Cloud ecosystem.

### 6.2.1 Data Retention

- Order data will be retained for a minimum of 3 years to comply with common business regulations.
- User activity logs will be retained for 1 year.
- Inventory snapshots will be taken daily and retained for 1 year to allow for historical analysis.

### 6.2.2 Redundancy and Backup

- Google Cloud SQL will be configured for high availability with automatic failover.
- Daily automated backups will be performed and retained for 30 days.
- Point-in-time recovery will be enabled, allowing for data restoration to any point within the last 7 days.

### 6.2.3 Recovery

- Vertical scaling (increasing machine resources) will be the primary method for handling increased load.
- If required, horizontal scaling through read replicas can be implemented for handling increased read traffic.

## 6.3 DATA PROCESSING

### 6.3.1 Data Flow

The following diagram illustrates the high-level data flow within the system:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Shopify] -->|Orders| B[Application Backend]
    B -->|Inventory Updates| A
    B -->|Store Data| C[Google Cloud SQL]
    D[Warehouse Staff] -->|Scans/Updates| E[Web Application]
    E -->|API Requests| B
    B -->|Shipping Labels| F[Sendle API]
    C -->|Retrieve Data| B
```

### 6.3.2 Data Security

To ensure data security throughout the processing flow:

1. Encryption in Transit:
   - All data transmissions between components will use TLS 1.3 or higher.
   - API endpoints will only be accessible via HTTPS.

2. Encryption at Rest:
   - Google Cloud SQL databases will have encryption at rest enabled using Google-managed encryption keys.

3. Access Control:
   - Application will use OAuth 2.0 for authentication and JWT for maintaining user sessions.
   - Role-based access control (RBAC) will be implemented to restrict data access based on user roles.

4. API Security:
   - API keys will be used for Shopify and Sendle API integrations.
   - API keys and other secrets will be stored securely using Google Cloud Secret Manager.

5. Data Validation:
   - All input data will be validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks.
   - Parameterized queries will be used for database operations to prevent SQL injection.

6. Audit Logging:
   - All data modifications will be logged with timestamps and user information.
   - Logs will be stored securely and will be immutable to ensure accountability.

7. Data Masking:
   - Sensitive customer information will be masked in logs and non-production environments.

8. Regular Security Audits:
   - Periodic security audits and penetration testing will be conducted to identify and address vulnerabilities.

By implementing these data requirements, the Inventory Management and Fulfillment Application will ensure data integrity, availability, and security while providing the necessary functionality for efficient order processing and inventory management. The use of Google Cloud SQL aligns with the preference for Google Cloud ecosystem solutions, while the data models and processing flow support the TypeScript/React frontend and Python backend architecture specified in earlier sections of the SRS.
