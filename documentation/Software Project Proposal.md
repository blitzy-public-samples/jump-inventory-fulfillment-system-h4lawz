| Miscellaneous | Contingency Fund | 1 | $10,000 | $10,000 |
| **Total** | | | | **$148,000** |

### PAYMENT SCHEDULE

The proposed payment schedule is tied to project milestones and deliverables:

| Milestone | Deliverable | Payment Percentage | Amount |
|-----------|-------------|---------------------|--------|
| Project Kickoff | Signed contract and initial planning documents | 20% | $29,600 |
| Design Approval | Approved UI/UX designs and technical architecture | 20% | $29,600 |
| Development Phase 1 | Completed core functionality (order management, inventory management) | 25% | $37,000 |
| Development Phase 2 | Completed API integrations (Shopify, Sendle) | 20% | $29,600 |
| User Acceptance Testing | Successful completion of UAT and bug fixes | 10% | $14,800 |
| Project Completion | Final deployment and handover of documentation | 5% | $7,400 |
| **Total** | | **100%** | **$148,000** |

### BUDGET CONSIDERATIONS

Several factors could potentially impact the budget. We have identified these risks and proposed mitigation strategies:

1. **Scope Creep**
   - Risk: Additional features or changes requested during development.
   - Mitigation: Clearly defined scope in the contract, change request process with associated costs.

2. **API Integration Complexity**
   - Risk: Unforeseen challenges in integrating with Shopify or Sendle APIs.
   - Mitigation: Allocated additional hours in the estimate for integration work, early prototyping of API interactions.

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Risk: Additional time required to meet performance requirements for large inventories.
   - Mitigation: Performance testing throughout development, scalable architecture design from the start.

4. **Currency Fluctuations**
   - Risk: If the project spans multiple months, currency exchange rates could affect costs.
   - Mitigation: All costs are quoted in USD, with a clause for rate adjustment if fluctuation exceeds 5%.

5. **Third-Party Software Costs**
   - Risk: Potential increase in licensing costs for development tools or services.
   - Mitigation: Locked-in rates with vendors where possible, contingency fund to cover potential increases.

    A[Budget Risks] --> B[Scope Creep]
    A --> C[API Integration Complexity]
    A --> D[Performance Optimization]
    A --> E[Currency Fluctuations]

```

The contingency fund of $10,000 has been included in the budget to address these potential risks. Any unused portion of this fund will be returned to the client at the project's conclusion. Regular budget reviews will be conducted throughout the project lifecycle to ensure costs remain within the agreed-upon limits.
